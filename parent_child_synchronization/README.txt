The sample output after executing the above instruction looks like this :

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is child (j) = 1 and pid = 2893
This is child (j) = 2 and pid = 2896
This is child (j) = 3 and pid = 2894
This is child (j) = 4 and pid = 2897
This is child (j) = 5 and pid = 2895

All the 5 child processes has terminated
Now terminating their parent process
